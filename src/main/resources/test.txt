Reading from the InputStream channel returns -1 on hitting EOF (end-of-file). At that point flip the buffer. This sets the position of the pointer within the buffer to 0 and the limit to the last byte read. Following which, bytes can be transferred from the pointer position to the OutputStream channel till the limit. At which point, the buffer can be cleared to reset the position and the limit.
